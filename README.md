# Leda

Overview

Leda: Mother of Agents is a unique application built with Gemini AI, designed to spawn teams of autonomous agents from a single prompt. It leverages the power of sequential and dependent chain prompting to create complex, multi-agent systems that work collaboratively to achieve a wide range of tasks, effectively building mini-applications based on user-defined criteria.
Features

    Sequential Agent Execution: Orchestrates a series of agents where each agent's output becomes the input for the next, creating a sophisticated chain of actions and reactions.
    Dynamic Script Planning: Formulates detailed plans for multi-agent interactions and workflows, tailored to the specific requirements of the user's idea.
    Automated Script Generation: Automatically generates Python scripts that bring the planned multi-agent system to life, ensuring each script is ready for real-world deployment.
    Adaptive Chain Prompting: Showcases a flexible and intelligent approach to task resolution, with each agent capable of adjusting its contribution based on the evolving context provided by preceding agents.
